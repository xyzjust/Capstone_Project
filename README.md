# CapstoneProject

#### Build an automatica trading bot by leveraging ML techniques


## Motivation

The practice of using machines to provide and follow through with a trading strategy has been done for decades with billions of investments into the technology to facilitate this. Historically, this project could have only been done in a research facility with access to a bloomberg terminal as well as the coding behind it to automatically place trades. However, the rise in crypto-currency as well as crypto-exchanges, facilitated by open source programming languages (e.g. Python) and increase in computing power. All these elements have resulted in the possibilities of doing such a project, with nothing more than a good computer and an internet connection to.

## Result
A mock up of a trading pipeline has successfully been coded up, however, the strategy is somewhat rudimentary. Further improvements are needed.
